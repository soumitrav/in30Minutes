Diff between copy and add
diff between ENTRYPOINT and CMD

--------

copy - to copy the file to image
add - is copy or download using url

----------------

CMD : when we use CMD we can pass the command while running the docker container. the default parameters are overridden when passed.
ENTRYPOINT : make the docker as image as executable and doesn't replace the arguments pass while running the docker image

we can override the entrypoint using --entrypoint command line option.

-------------
push the image to docker

Docker login
change the docker id in pom.xml

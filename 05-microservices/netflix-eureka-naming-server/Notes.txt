scale up:
  docker-compose scale currency-exchange-service=3 - deprecated
  docker-compose up --scale currency-exchange-service=2
  
  we need to disable the port as follows in currency-exchange-service:
   #ports:
      #- "8000:8000"
      
   if used ports then it will throw exception saying port is already is in use. since the port is not exposed to host using 
   ports we will not be able to check the service using localhost:8000
